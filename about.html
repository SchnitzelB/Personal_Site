      <h3>Started skateboarding at age Seven</h3>
        <p>2005. Overall, I feel as though I had a normal upbringing, with the exception of relocating around the country frequently. However, up until that year, I shared many interests with most of my peers. Baseball and video games were all I would think about. This was the case, until my parents had purchased inexpensive "toys" from Walmart called "skateboards". The most enticing part about the skateboard was the ability to ride down hills at an intense speed. This is also known as, bombing a hill. Keep in mind, as an adolesent, injuries were never kept in mind while performing any sort of trick. Even being 23 years young, injuries are never come to mind.</p>

        <p>"If skateboarding ever gets too scary for you, then you were never meant to skate in the first place." - Jake Phelps, Thrasher, Former Editor-in-Chief</p>

      <h3>Solo travel to Tokyo</h3>
        <p>At this point in my life, traveling wasn't my first rodeo. I've gone on numerous trips in my life. This trip, in particular, set the bar for any future trips I will go on. From highs, to lows; love gained and lost. The mix of emotions this trip bestowed upon me, left an imprint on my life. Aside from the cluster of emotions, friends, memories and new pastimes may find their origins in that span of a month, alone and in Tokyo, Japan. いつも、がんばるでいます！　(I'm always trying my best!)</p>
